let inputText = "Alice sets a stringent standard for authors when she pointedly inquires: What is the use of a book without pictures or conversations? This book has no compelling pictures and only indirect descriptions of highly abstruse conversations. What Virtual Muse does have is this address on the World Wide Web: Here you will find MacProse, a Macintosh version of the PROSE prograin described in chapter 7, ready to be downloaded and run. Key parts of the source code are also available, for those who'd like to tinker. In the future, I hope to add other programs to this site once I have wrestled them into a usable state. Programs written for research and experimentation tend to crash in annoying ways when used by anybody but their author. These probably will include the DOS version of PROSE";
